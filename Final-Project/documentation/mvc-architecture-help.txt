For ANY new resource you need the following:

Routes:
    GET -> [
        /resource               => ResourceController::index
        /resource/new           => ResourceController::_new
        /resouce/:id            => ResourceController::show
        /resource/edit/:id      => ResourceController::edit
        /resource/delete/:id    => ResourceController::delete
    ],
    POST -> [
        /resource/create        => ResourceController::create
        /resource/update        => ResourceController::update
    ]

models/ResourceModel:
    findAll()                   -> fetches all rows from the database
    find()                      -> fetches an existing row from the database
    create()                    -> creates a new row in the database
    update()                    -> updates an existing row in the database
    delete()                    -> removes an existing row from the database

controllers/ResourceController:
    index()                     -> collects all resource rows and calls render for resource/index
    new()                       -> calls render for resource/new
    show()                      -> collects existing resource row and calls render for resource/show
    edit()                      -> collects existing resource row and calls render for resource/edit
    create()                    -> validates and has the model create a new resource row
    update()                    -> validates and has the model update an existing resource row
    delete()                    -> validates and has the model remove an existing resource row

views/resource:
    index                       -> renders list of resource rows
    new                         -> renders form for new resource
    edit                        -> renders form for editing existing resource
    show                        -> renders single resource information
    _form                       -> partial for new and edit form
