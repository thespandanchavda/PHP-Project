Controllers:

    Controllers represent a collection of functions (actions) you want to call. Each action is responsible for collecting any required data and rendering any required view. The controller facilitates all communication between the model and the view.

    The following are common controller actions and what they do:

    VIEW ACTIONS:
        index()             -> asks the model for all the rows of the resource in the database.
                            -> renders the resource/index view, passing the rows as a local variable

        show($request)      -> asks the model for a specific row in the database, using a passed ID
                            -> renders the resource/show view, passing the row as a local variable

        new()               -> renders the resource/new view

        edit($request)      -> asks the model for a specific row in the database, using a passed ID
                            -> renders the resource/edit view, passing the row as a local variable

    PROCESSING ACTIONS:
        create()            -> validates the POST body (form data) and asks the model
                               to create a new row in the database

        update()            -> validates the POST body (form data) and asks the model
                               to update an existing row in the database

        delete()            -> validates the POST body (form data) and asks the model
                               to delete an existing row in the database
